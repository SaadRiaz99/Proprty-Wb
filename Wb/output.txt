I have made the necessary corrections to `app/models.py`:
- Removed the `Confirm_password` field from both `doctorsignup` and `patientsignup` models, as it's typically used for form validation and not for database storage.
- Changed the `password` field in the `patientsignup` model from `EmailField` to `CharField` and set its `max_length` to 128 for storing hashed passwords securely.

To apply these changes to your database and resolve the `OperationalError`, please run the following Django management commands in your project's root directory (`D:\python\Wb\project`):

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

After running these commands, the `OperationalError` should be resolved, and you should be able to access the admin interface for `doctorsignup` without issues.

Please let me know if you encounter any further problems.
